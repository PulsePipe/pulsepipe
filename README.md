# PulsePipe

**PulsePipe** is a modular, AI-native healthcare data pipeline. It ingests clinical data (HL7 v2, FHIR, X12, CDA/CCDA, plain text, and custom templates), de-identifies and normalizes it, prepares it for LLM-friendly text processing, and generates vector representations for AI/ML tasks.

PulsePipe transforms healthcare data into embedding-ready chunks annotated with rich metadata (patient hashes, timestamps, note types, etc.). It supports generating multiple vector formats via configurable embedding engines (ClinicalBERT, GPT-4, Llama v4, and others) for use in vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.

## üöÄ Use Cases

PulsePipe is designed for AI-powered healthcare applications including:
- Clinical semantic search
- Clinical decision support
- Patient similarity matching
- Embedding-driven analytics
- Hybrid structured + unstructured data pipelines
- **Local question-answering on clinical data** - ask questions about patient history, treatments, and outcomes without sending PHI to external services
- **Operational analytics** - analyze resource utilization, workflows, and quality metrics using natural language queries

   Generates one or more embedding vectors per chunk using:
   - ClinicalBERT (local)
   - OpenAI GPT-family (via API)
   - Llama v4 (optional)

   Embeddings and metadata are persisted into:
   - Pinecone
   - Weaviate
   - FAISS
   - or a custom vector backend

### Docker Setup for Vector Databases

PulsePipe works with various vector databases which can be easily set up using Docker. We provide ready-to-use configurations for Weaviate and Qdrant to simplify your development and testing process.

```bash
# Navigate to the vector database setup directory
cd tests/docker_environment/vectordatabases

# Start Weaviate and Qdrant
docker compose up -d

# Check running containers
docker ps

# Stop the databases
docker compose down
```

The `docker-compose.yaml` includes:

#### Weaviate Configuration
```yaml
weaviate:
  image: semitechnologies/weaviate:1.27.17
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"    # HTTP API
    - "50051:50051"  # gRPC API
  environment:
    ENABLE_MODULES: ""
    DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: "none"
    ENABLE_GRPC: "true"
    CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: "node1"
```

#### Qdrant Configuration
```yaml
qdrant:
  image: qdrant/qdrant
  ports:
    - "6333:6333"
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "http://localhost:6333/collections"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
```

For production deployments or custom configurations, you can modify the environment variables and port mappings as needed.

### üí¨ Clinical and Operational Chat Prompts

PulsePipe's vector embeddings enable powerful question-answering capabilities over clinical data. Below are example prompts for common clinical and operational use cases.


### üí¨ Clinical and Operational Chat Prompts

PulsePipe's vector embeddings enable powerful question-answering capabilities over clinical data. Below are example prompts for common clinical and operational use cases.

#### Clinical Chat Prompts

```
# Medication Review (Patient)
Are there any potential drug interactions or conflicts with the medications
I am currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs?

# Medication Adherence (Patient)
How can I better manage my medication schedule and ensure I‚Äôm taking my medications
as prescribed?

# Medication Adherence (Guardian/Caretaker)
Based on my loved one's medication record, are there any duplicate medications
or overlapping ingredients that could lead to accidental overdosing or adverse effects?

# Medication Monitoring (Guardian/Caretaker)
What signs should I look for to detect potential side effects or reactions from
the medications my loved one is taking?

# Medication Reconciliation (Nurse/PA/APN)
Does this patient's current medication list include prescriptions that were filled
but are no longer in use or do not align with any current diagnoses (e.g., short-term
medications like antibiotics or pain relievers)? Please highlight any discrepancies.

# Patient Monitoring (Nurse/PA/APN)
Based on the patient's current vital signs and medication list, which areas of
concern should I monitor most closely in the next 24 hours?

# Treatment Adjustments (Physician)
Given this patient's current medication list and comorbidities, what treatment
adjustments should be made to improve their overall health outcome?

# Medication Optimization (Physician)
Based on this patient‚Äôs diabetes and hypertension medications, which additional
treatment options should we consider to prevent complications like CHF or CKD?
```

#### Operational Chat Prompts

```
# Billing and Denials
Which procedures had the highest denial rates last quarter and what documentation issues contributed?

# Workforce Efficiency
Identify departments with the most overtime logged and does it align with patient acuity data?

# Service Line Profitability
Which service lines generated the highest revenue per encounter last quarter, and how does that compare to staffing and supply costs?

# Revenue Cycle Health
What are the top reasons for delayed payments from insurers in the past 6 months?

# Clinical Outcome Risk Patterns
Which clinical pathways show the highest variance between expected and actual outcomes, and what operational factors (delays in care, missed protocols, communication gaps) are driving poor quality metrics that could trigger CMS penalties?

# Nursing-Sensitive Quality & Staffing Analysis
What is the correlation between nursing staffing ratios and our nursing-sensitive quality indicators (falls, pressure injuries, CAUTI, CLABSI) across all units, and which departments are approaching unsafe thresholds that require immediate staffing intervention?
```

Configure these prompts in your application by using PulsePipe's embedding context:

```python
from pulsepipe.chat import PulseChat

# Initialize chat with your vector database
chat = PulseChat(vector_store="weaviate", collection="patient_data")

# Run a clinical query with metadata filters
response = chat.query(
    prompt="What treatment options were considered for this patient's condition?",
    filters={
        "patient_id": "123456",
        "date_range": {"from": "2023-01-01", "to": "2023-06-30"},
        "document_types": ["progress_notes", "consults"]
    }
)
```
