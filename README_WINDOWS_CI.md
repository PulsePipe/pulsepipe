# Windows CI Testing Support

## Overview

This project now includes enhanced support for Windows testing environments, specifically addressing file handling issues that can occur during CI test runs on Windows:

- "I/O operation on closed file" errors
- Path normalization failures 
- File handle leaks
- Inconsistent path separators

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive mock solution in `tests/windows_mock.py` that:

1. Creates a virtual in-memory file system for all test file operations
2. Normalizes all paths to use forward slashes consistently 
3. Intercepts logging operations to avoid file handle issues
4. Preserves access to real test fixtures while mocking other file operations

## Benefits

- **Simplified Testing**: No need for platform-specific test code
- **Isolated Tests**: Each test operates on a fresh in-memory file system
- **Consistent Paths**: Path separators are normalized across platforms
- **Fewer Flaky Tests**: Eliminates file handle and cleanup issues

## Implementation Details

The solution works by:

1. Early loading in `conftest.py` to patch key file operation functions
2. Automatic activation when running on Windows during pytest sessions
3. Creating a virtual file system to track "file operations" in memory
4. Special handling for test fixtures to ensure they're still accessible

## Usage in CI

No special configuration is needed in CI - the solution activates automatically when tests are run on Windows. Test outputs that would normally go to disk are tracked in memory instead.

## Local Development on Windows

When running tests locally on Windows, the solution will automatically activate. You may notice:

- Log files aren't actually written to disk during tests
- File operations during tests don't affect your actual file system
- Path separators in error messages will be forward slashes 

## Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements:

- Add environment variable to toggle mock behavior for specific tests
- Extend mock to cover more file operations as needed
- Add detailed logging of mocked operations for debugging
