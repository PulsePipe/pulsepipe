- [ ] UMLS & SNOMED CT Concept Tagging (standardized clinical terminology mapping)
- [ ] Support for additional clinical embeddings:
    - GatorTron (if available)
    - Med-BERT
    - Custom user-provided models
- [ ] Multi-vector search strategies
- [ ] Improved canonical data model to include:
    - Problem Lists
    - Medications
    - Labs
    - Imaging Reports
- [ ] PulsePilot UI:
    - Enhanced search UX
    - Visualization components (embedding space plots, concept graph)

- [ ] Streaming data ingestion and dispatcher:
    - HL7 Listener (MLLP / TCP)
    - FHIR Webhook (REST)
    - Kafka / Pulsar consumer
    - Generic dispatcher for routing inbound events

    - Transfer learning pipeline
    - Embedding + supervised task workflows
- [ ] SaaS Offering for PulsePilot.
- [ ] Distributed / parallelized embedding pipeline:
    - Embedding workers
    - Chunk-level parallelism
    - Optimized for serverless and containerized environments
- [ ] First-class support for open-source clinical models:
    - DeepSeek
    - Meta Llama (with healthcare adaptations)
    - BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and Med-BERT family
- [ ] Production-ready **PulsePilot** UI:
    - End-user ready
    - Query builders and advanced search
    - Reporting and export (CSV, PDF, JSONL)
    - Embedding visualization (optional)
