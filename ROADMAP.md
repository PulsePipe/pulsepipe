## ðŸŸ£ Short-Term Goals (v0.2.x - v0.3.x)

- [ ] Support for generating **multiple embedding formats** simultaneously (e.g., BERT + GPT vectors)
- [ ] Improved de-identification pipelines:
    - Incorporate clinical-specific regex library
    - BioClinicalBERT + Presidio joint recognizer
- [ ] Optional SNOMED CT and ICD code extraction for terminology enrichment
- [ ] CDA / CCDA document ingestion
- [ ] Custom template ingestion (extensible ingestor system)
- [ ] Plain text ingestion
- [ ] Support for embedding metadata directly into vector stores
- [ ] Optional export of embeddings to offline formats (Parquet, Feather)
- [ ] Global persistence for file watcher cache and other cache using PostgreSQL (PulsePilot Exclusive)
- [ ] Global persistence using cloud-native backends (e.g., AWS S3 + DynamoDB) (PulsePilot Exclusive)
- [ ] Add REST API Ingestion Adapter to the factory
- [ ] PulsePilot UI (React + FastAPI)
    - View and manage active pipelines: Allows users to start, stop, and monitor pipeline activity (e.g., HL7 â†’ FHIR â†’ Vector store), with real-time logs and status.
    - UI for editing configuration (typically maintained via YAML files): Visual interface for editing pipeline and system configurations that are usually managed manually via YAMLâ€”includes validation, schemas, and save/publish controls.
    - Monitor ingestion performance and metrics: Dashboards to track ingestion throughput, processing time, and error rates for each stage of the pipeline.
    - Analyze de-identification processes: Insights into how identifiers are removed or replacedâ€”includes PHI detection types, counts, and potential misses.
    - Visualize document chunking activity: UI for inspecting how documents are chunked for embeddingâ€”chunk size, overlap, structure warnings, etc.
    - Inspect embedding performance and statistics: Tracks which embedding models were used, token usage, embedding sizes, success/failure rates, and latency.
    - Explore metadata extraction and usage: Displays key extracted metadata (e.g., patient ID, doc type, timestamps), showing how it's used for indexing, filtering, and downstream querying.
    - Enable basic vector space visualization and inspection: Provides 2D/3D projections (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) of embedded vectors to explore clustering and identify embedding anomalies or outliers.
