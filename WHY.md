# Why PulsePipe Exists

PulsePipe exists to enable AI-powered healthcare applications without compromising patient privacy, data control, or operational resilience.

## Mission

To provide healthcare organizations, researchers, and AI engineers with a robust, open-source, and production-ready data pipeline for preparing clinical data for AI/ML workflows — while respecting the regulatory, ethical, and technical realities of healthcare.

## Why Not Just Use SaaS?

See [WHY_LOCAL_AI_FOR_HEALTHCARE.md](docs/WHY_LOCAL_AI_FOR_HEALTHCARE.md) for a detailed rationale on why **local AI** is often the best choice for healthcare organizations.

## Why Offer PulsePilot?

[PulsePilot](docs/WHY_SAAS_WITH_PULSEPILOT.md) is not just a hosted version of PulsePipe — it is the official **PulsePipe UI** and **SaaS offering**, providing:

- A web-based interface for pipeline orchestration and management
- Integrated embedding exploration and similarity search
- Visualization of clinical vector spaces
- Hosted, production-ready infrastructure for organizations who prefer a managed service

PulsePilot is ideal for teams who want:
- Faster time-to-value without the burden of managing infrastructure
- A clean, usable UI for working with PulsePipe pipelines and outputs
- Access to PulsePipe's full AI capabilities without sacrificing control of their data when hybrid or local deployments are needed

## In Short

Healthcare organizations deserve:

- Control of their data
- Transparent AI workflows
- Infrastructure they actually own
- The option of a **hosted UI and pipeline manager** via PulsePilot when appropriate

PulsePipe and PulsePilot together provide a flexible, open, and production-ready foundation for AI-powered healthcare applications.
