# PulsePipe: AI-Native Pipelines for Chunked, De-Identified, Vectorized Clinical Data for RAG and LLMs

## Abstract

As generative AI reshapes clinical informatics, healthcare systems are increasingly interested in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows to surface insights from vast stores of structured and unstructured data. However, real-world clinical data—fragmented across HL7, FHIR, X12, CDA, and narrative notes—remains ill-suited for direct use in AI pipelines due to privacy constraints, semantic inconsistency, and lack of vectorization.

**PulsePipe** is a modular, open-source pipeline that transforms multimodal healthcare inputs into chunked, de-identified, vectorized artifacts optimized for LLM-ready and RAG-aligned consumption. It ingests diverse data formats, normalizes them into a dual-layer Canonical Data Model (CDM), strips PHI using layered de-identification (Presidio + Clinical NER), and generates embedding-enriched vector representations using pluggable models like ClinicalBERT, OpenAI GPT, or Llama v4. The resulting chunks—annotated with patient-safe metadata—are stored in vector databases for semantic search, similarity matching, and grounded generation.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** represents a breakthrough pattern in clinical AI: by grounding large language models in relevant patient data, we can power safer summarization, explainable decision support, and precision recall across longitudinal records. Yet most real-world clinical data cannot be directly used for RAG. It is:

* Trapped in heterogeneous formats (HL7, CDA, X12, PDF)
* Laden with protected health information (PHI)
* Poorly chunked and poorly contextualized for embeddings

To enable RAG in regulated healthcare environments, we must first convert raw inputs into **chunked, de-identified, vectorized data with embeddings and metadata suitable for filtering, grounding, and indexing.**

PulsePipe offers a privacy-compliant, production-grade substrate for building safe, scalable, and explainable RAG pipelines in healthcare AI systems.

## 1. Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a breakthrough pattern in clinical AI: by grounding large language models in relevant patient data, we can power safer summarization, explainable decision support, and precision recall across longitudinal records. Yet most real-world clinical data cannot be directly used for RAG. It is:

* Trapped in heterogeneous formats (HL7, CDA, X12, PDF)
* Laden with protected health information (PHI)
* Poorly chunked and poorly contextualized for embeddings

To enable RAG in regulated healthcare environments, we must first convert raw inputs into chunked, de-identified, vectorized data with embeddings and metadata suitable for filtering, grounding, and indexing.

PulsePipe is a purpose-built framework for this transformation.

It offers:

* Modular ingestion across clinical formats
* Normalization into a structured Canonical Data Model (CDM)
* Multi-step de-identification (rule-based + NER-based)
* Composable chunking pipelines
* Support for multiple embedding models
* Integration with modern vector databases
* Metadata-enriched output tailored for RAG architecture

With PulsePipe, healthcare systems can locally power:

* RAG-enhanced clinical assistants
* Case-based retrieval systems
* Similarity matching
* LLM-driven summarization and question answering

All without leaking PHI to external APIs or relying on vendor lock-in.

## 2. System Architecture

PulsePipe is designed as a composable pipeline with the following core stages:

1. **Ingestion**: Data is sourced from multiple healthcare formats including HL7 v2, FHIR (JSON/XML), CDA/CCDA, X12 (837, 835, 270/271), and unstructured text. A file watcher and adapter factory enable continuous monitoring of incoming data.

2. **Normalization (CDM)**: PulsePipe translates raw data into a dual Canonical Data Model:

   * **Clinical CDM**: Vitals, labs, notes, meds, diagnoses, encounters
   * **Operational CDM**: Claims, denials, staffing, billing metadata

3. **De-identification**:

   * **Rule-based masking** using Presidio (e.g., dates, MRNs, addresses)
   * **NER-based PHI extraction** using models like BioClinicalBERT or medSpaCy
   * Optional visualization layer for audit and validation (planned)

4. **Chunking**:

   * Modular chunkers split documents by structure, semantics, or tokens
   * NarrativeChunker, BundleSplitterChunker, and custom strategies supported
   * Each chunk is enriched with:

     * Patient hash (non-reversible ID)
     * Timestamps
     * Source type and document ID
     * Encounter metadata

5. **Embedding**:

   * Multiple embedders supported:

     * ClinicalBERT (local)
     * MiniLM-L6-v2 (operational data)
     * OpenAI GPT-3/4 (via API)
     * Llama v4 (on-prem or hosted)
   * Each chunk may produce multiple embeddings (multi-vector per chunk)

6. **Storage**:

   * Vectors and metadata are persisted to:

     * Qdrant
     * Weaviate
     * FAISS
     * Planned: Pinecone, pgvector, MongoDB Atlas, Redis, Milvus

7. **Query Layer (Optional)**:

   * PulsePilot UI and PulseChat API for semantic search and filtered retrieval
   * Designed to support RAG pipelines and domain-tuned assistants

## 3. Canonical Data Model (CDM) and AI Readiness

A key innovation in PulsePipe is the Canonical Data Model, which bridges the semantic gap between inconsistent real-world inputs and the structured requirements of AI systems.

* **Why CDM Matters**:

  * Aligns concept mappings across HL7, FHIR, X12
  * Supports consistent chunking and token budgeting
  * Allows pre-filtering by structured criteria (e.g., lab type, code class)

* **CDM for Embeddings**:

  * Guarantees schema-consistent embeddings across datasets
  * Enables AI-driven normalization suggestions (planned)

* **CDM for Governance**:

  * Ensures field-level auditability, enabling PHI boundary verification
  * Forms a contract between ingestion and embedding pipelines

## 4. Chunking and Metadata Strategy

PulsePipe's chunking system combines traditional structural approaches with AI-powered semantic analysis:

### 1. **Intelligent Boundary Detection**
- **Clinical NER Models**: Identify medical entities (medications, procedures, conditions) to avoid splitting related concepts
- **Sentence Transformer Analysis**: Ensure chunks maintain semantic coherence using contextual embeddings
- **Clinical Context Preservation**: Maintain relationships between symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments within chunk boundaries

### 2. **Multi-Modal Chunking Strategies**

#### **Narrative Chunking (AI-Enhanced)**
- Uses clinical language models to identify natural section breaks in clinical notes
- Preserves SOAP note structure while ensuring optimal token density
- Maintains temporal relationships within clinical narratives

#### **Structured Data Chunking**
- **Bundle Splitting**: FHIR bundles intelligently segmented by clinical episode
- **Lab Result Grouping**: Related lab values grouped by clinical significance
- **Medication Regimen Preservation**: Drug interactions and related prescriptions kept together

#### **Hybrid Semantic-Structural Chunking**
- Combines rule-based boundary detection with AI semantic analysis
- Ensures each chunk is both structurally complete and semantically meaningful
- Optimizes for embedding model input requirements (e.g., 512, 2048, 4096 token limits)

### 3. **Context-Aware Metadata Enrichment**

Each AI-generated chunk includes:

```yaml
chunk_metadata:
  # Core identifiers
  patient_hash: "abc123..." # Non-reversible patient identifier
  encounter_hash: "def456..." # De-identified encounter ID
  
  # Temporal context
  timestamp_range:
    start: "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z"
    end: "2023-06-15T14:45:00Z"
  
  # Clinical context (AI-extracted)
  clinical_concepts:
    primary_conditions: ["diabetes_type_2", "hypertension"]
    medications_mentioned: ["metformin", "lisinopril"]
    procedures_referenced: ["hba1c_test", "blood_pressure_check"]
  
  # Document context
  source_document:
    type: "progress_note"
    section: "assessment_and_plan"
    specialty: "endocrinology"
  
  # AI chunking metadata
  chunking_strategy: "clinical_semantic"
  semantic_coherence_score: 0.92
  clinical_completeness: true
```

PulsePipe's AI chunking adapts to content type and downstream use:

- **Token Budget Optimization**: Dynamically adjusts chunk size based on embedding model requirements
- **Overlap Strategy**: Intelligent overlapping that preserves context without redundancy
- **Clinical Priority Weighting**: Prioritizes chunks containing high-value clinical information

### Clinical Note Chunking
```python
# AI-driven clinical note chunking
chunker = PulsePipe.chunkers.ClinicalSemanticChunker(
    model="clinical-bert-v1.0",
    preserve_entities=True,
    maintain_temporal_sequence=True,
    target_token_count=1024,
    overlap_ratio=0.1
)

chunks = chunker.process(clinical_note)
# Result: Semantically coherent chunks that preserve clinical relationships
```

### Lab Result Clustering
```python
# AI-powered lab result grouping
chunker = PulsePipe.chunkers.LabSemanticChunker(
    group_by_clinical_significance=True,
    preserve_reference_ranges=True,
    maintain_trending_context=True
)

chunks = chunker.process(lab_bundle)
# Result: Related lab values grouped by clinical meaning, not just timestamp
```

## 6. RAG and Downstream Applications

RAG pipelines benefit directly from PulsePipe's normalization and chunking layers. By providing clean, schema-consistent, and semantically aligned chunks with metadata, PulsePipe improves retrieval precision and narrows LLM context windows. This reduces hallucinations, increases interpretability, and enhances confidence in responses. Robust normalization and high-quality chunking are critical to the success of any clinical RAG system and will receive dedicated investment and attention.

PulsePipe also supports a growing set of natural language prompts that illustrate its application in both clinical and operational contexts:

### Clinical RAG Prompts:
- "Based on the patient’s medication list and vitals over the past 3 months, what signs of deterioration should I monitor for?"
- "Which clinical guidelines were followed or skipped for this CHF admission?"
- "Find similar patients who responded positively to Treatment Y for condition X."
- "Summarize key concerns from cardiology and oncology consult notes over the last 12 months."
- "What are the longitudinal trends in eGFR and creatinine for this patient since 2020?"

### Operational RAG Prompts:
- "What are the top causes of claims denials in the last quarter, grouped by department?"
- "Are staffing ratios in ICU linked to readmission spikes in recent months?"
- "Which service lines have a negative margin after adjusting for supply and overtime costs?"
- "Identify delays in care that contributed to quality metric penalties in Q4."
- "What documentation deficiencies triggered RAC audits for orthopedic procedures?"

These use cases demonstrate how RAG systems built on PulsePipe can provide grounded, contextual responses with traceable source metadata—enhancing not only clinical quality but also operational insight and decision-making.

With chunked, de-identified, vectorized data in hand, PulsePipe enables:

- **Clinical RAG Agents**:
