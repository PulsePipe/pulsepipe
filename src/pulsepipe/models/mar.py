    Represents a Medication Administration Record entry.
    
    The Medication Administration Record (MAR) documents the actual 
    administration of medications to a patient, as opposed to medication
    orders or prescriptions. MAR entries provide a detailed log of what
    medications were given, when, and by whom, serving as both a legal
    record and clinical documentation of patient care.
    
    Each entry typically represents a single medication administration event.
