    Temporary storage container for message processing state.
    
    This model is used during the ingestion process to maintain context and 
    track relationships between different healthcare data elements as they're 
    being processed. It helps associate resources with their primary identifiers
    and maintains a resource index for efficient lookups.
    
    The cache helps resolve references between different parts of a message,
    especially when processing complex documents like FHIR bundles or HL7 
    messages with multiple segments.
