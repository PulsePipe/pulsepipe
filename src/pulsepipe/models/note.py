    Represents a clinical note documenting patient care.
    
    Clinical notes are narrative text documents created by healthcare providers
    to record observations, assessments, plans, and other aspects of patient care.
    They may include admission notes, progress notes, consultation notes,
    discharge summaries, procedure notes, or other documentation types.
    
    Notes provide crucial context and details that may not be captured in
    structured data elements and often contain the rationale for clinical decisions.
