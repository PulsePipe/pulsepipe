    Represents a pathology examination report on tissue specimens.
    
    Pathology reports document the examination of cells and tissues by a 
    pathologist to diagnose disease. They're crucial for cancer diagnosis,
    staging, and treatment planning, as well as for diagnosing other
    conditions that require tissue analysis.
    
    A complete report typically includes specimen information, gross and 
    microscopic descriptions, and a diagnostic interpretation with additional
    information like cancer staging and grading where applicable.
