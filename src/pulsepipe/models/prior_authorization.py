    Represents a prior authorization request or response.
    
    Prior authorizations are requests to health insurance companies for
    approval to provide specific services, medications, or procedures
    before they're delivered to patients. They're a key component of
    healthcare utilization management and cost control.
    
    This model captures both the request details and the payer's response,
    including approval status, authorized services, and relevant timeframes.
    Prior authorizations are typically handled via X12 278 transactions in
    healthcare EDI systems.
