    Represents an entry in a patient's problem list.
    
    The problem list is a central component of the medical record that 
    documents a patient's ongoing or chronic medical conditions requiring
    management over time. Unlike encounter-specific diagnoses, problem list
    entries represent longer-term conditions that influence care decisions
    across multiple encounters.
    
    Problem lists help providers maintain continuity of care and ensure
    that all ongoing medical issues are considered in clinical decision-making.
