    Represents social, behavioral, and environmental factors affecting a patient's health.
    
    Social history documents aspects of a patient's life that may impact their
    health status or treatment planning. This includes information about
    substance use (tobacco, alcohol, drugs), occupation, living situation,
    education, and other social determinants of health.
    
    These factors play a crucial role in holistic healthcare delivery and
    are essential for understanding risk factors, tailoring treatments, and
    addressing barriers to care.
