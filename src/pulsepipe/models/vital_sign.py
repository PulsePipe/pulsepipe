    """
    Represents a physiological measurement or vital sign.
    
    Vital signs are clinical measurements of essential body functions
    that provide critical indicators of a patient's physical state.
    Standard vital signs include temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate,
    respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, height, weight, and pain level.
    
    These measurements form the foundation of patient assessment and
    are used to track changes in a patient's condition over time.
    Abnormal vital signs often serve as early indicators of clinical
    deterioration or improvement.
